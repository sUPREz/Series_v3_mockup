However, things begin to get complicated when her new boss insists that a wild and unpredictable movie star joins the cast.This episode was pretty similar to the one that aired, with only some differences in terms of the direction of the show. Perhaps the most notable difference is the fact that Rachel Dratch had a starring role, from which she was replaced due to creative reasons and given different recurring roles.

Just before the taping, Tracy Jordan becomes convinced that nothing is funnier than a performer laughing and breaking character, which he elects to do all night, much to Jenna Maroney's chagrin. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy struggles with the consequences of his promise to give up drinking while Avery is pregnant.

The episode was filmed twice.  The East Coast version aired for the Eastern, Central and Mountain time zones.   The West Coast version was aired in the western, Alaskan and Hawaiian time zones.

                            [Overview] =&gt; Kenneth (Jack McBrayer) takes drastic measures to prove why TGS should stay a live show. 

When their Kabletown bosses announce they will no longer pay for TGS to be a live show, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) realize their lives will actually be easier if they shoot canned episodes fast and cheap. Only Kenneth the page (McBrayer) objects, urging that nothing can replace the communal experience of live television. He tries to convince the TGS staff to fight for their right to be live by taking them and our audience through a magical look back at the illustrious history of Studio 6H.
